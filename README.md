Ionic 3 app to track services delivered on location

This is a complete rewrite of the ShotgunDriver onsite job service application using Ionic 3 / Angular 4.

It is a work in progress but aims to provide a publicly available reference implementation that can be integrated into the ShotgunDriver backend solutions or used to create a completely new mobile app that requires location based data capture.
